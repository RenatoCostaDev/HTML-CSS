        <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody’s born <em>smart</em>.</strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, we are <em>born to learn</em>.</strong><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Until one day, you walk.</strong><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for <em>growing</em>. And you keep going.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;This. is. learning.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;You just don’t get it, yet.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>

          You only have to know one thing:<br>
          You can learn anything.
